Popular Instagram influencer, Egungun of Lagos, is in the news again following a new video of him that surfaced online, where he effortlessly flaunts his brilliance.

While the Egungun of Lagos is well known for showcasing the faces of highly endowed ladies, the new clip of him is a mixture of education and entertainment.

In the new video spotted on his Instagram page, Egungun of Lagos was spotted interviewing a female baddie who graduated from Imo State University Department of Microbiology.

Upon meeting the lady, Egungun of Lagos asks her the question: *“What is the smallest bone in the ear called?”*

Responding, the lady said the eardrum and Egungun of Lagos reacted by bursting into laughter. This development hit the nerves of the female baddie who dared Egungun to mention the names of three bones in the human body.

Reacting, Egungun of Lagos went on to use the female baddie as a specimen and started mentioning names of bones like cranium, eye socket, mandible, maxilla, buccal cavity, scapula, clavicle, humerus, radius, phalanges, carpals, metacarpals, sacrum, tailbone, femur, patella, tibia, tarsals, metatarsals among others.

The lady, who seemed shocked, asked Egungun what he studied in university. He replied that he studied Biology and by extension, knows the names of 195 bones of the human body offhand out of the total 206 bones.

The young lady in the video bragged about using a Kanyamata ring for protection while stressing that she can never use a neat skin to cook for her man.
