## JUST IN: Senate approves Tinubu's request to deploy Nigerian troops to Benin Republic

The Senate has expeditiously approved the request by **President Bola Ahmed Tinubu** for the deployment of Nigerian troops to the Republic of Benin for a peace mission.

The approval was announced by Senate President **Godswill Akpabio** during plenary after lawmakers considered the request in the Committee of the Whole, in line with Section 5, Part II of the Constitution.

The senators unanimously voted in favour of the deployment, providing the required legislative backing for the regional security intervention.

Akpabio described the decision as timely and necessary, stressing that instability in any neighbouring country poses a direct threat to regional security.

### Tinubu’s Request
President Tinubu had earlier today written to the Senate, seeking its consent to deploy to the Benin Republic for combat operations.  

The letter, read by Senate President Akpabio, was in sequel to Section 5(5) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and emphasized the need for peacekeeping as a sister country.  

Tinubu explained that deploying the troops was in response to a request by the Benin Republic for assistance, considering the close ties of friendship and brotherhood.

### Coup Attempt in Benin
On **7 December**, several soldiers of the Benin Armed Forces led by Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Tigri announced the overthrow of President **Patrice Talon** on national television, following an attack on Talon’s residence in Cotonou.  

Later that afternoon, Interior Minister **Alassane Seidou** confirmed that Benin’s armed forces had foiled the attempted coup.  

Reports then emerged that Nigerian troops were deployed to Benin to help foil the coup attempt, which was confirmed by President Tinubu.

### Nigeria’s Intervention
Tinubu’s office stated that Nigeria’s military intervened after Talon’s government issued two requests for help, including for “immediate Nigerian air support.”  

Tinubu praised Nigeria’s armed forces for standing “as a defender and protector of constitutional order in the Republic of Benin on the invitation of the government.”

### Talon’s Response
Later that evening, President Talon appeared on state television to confirm Seidou’s announcement, promising to punish those responsible.  

> “I would like to assure you that the situation is completely under control and therefore invite you to calmly go about your activities starting this very evening,” Talon said.  

The rapid mobilisation of forces loyal to the government “allowed us to thwart these adventurers,” Talon added.  

> “This treachery will not go unpunished,” he declared.
